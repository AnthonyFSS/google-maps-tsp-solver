#summary How to run the solver test suite

= Introduction =

In order to run the tests, you must have *java*, *python* and *selenium rc* installed. Selenium RC can be downloaded from [http://seleniumhq.org/download/ SeleniumHQ]. 

= Details =

Start the selenium server:

{{{
cd where_you_downloaded_selenium_rc/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3/selenium-server-1.0.3/
java -jar selenium-server.jar
}}}

Then copy the selenium python client files to your google-maps-tsp-solver working directory:

{{{
cp where_you_downloaded_selenium_rc/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3/selenium-python-client-driver-1.0.1/*.py google-maps-tsp-solver/
}}}

Now run the tests with the gebweb.net version of the source files:

{{{
python selenium-tests.py
}}}

To test new versions of the .js files, upload the test.html and the .js files to your own server, change selenium-test.py to point to this server, and re-run the tests.
